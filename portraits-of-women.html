    <h2> In India women are pillars of domestic life, but their role in public life is still very limited, particularly in rural areas. Nonetheless, dressed in colorful saris, they can be seen everywhere hard at work, from fields to factories. They are visions of beauty and strength. </h2>

        <h3>JODPHUR</h3>
        <p>I passed by this woman sitting in the doorway of her home, bantering with neighbors and passersby. In her bright purple sari, she looked regal and proud, the strong matriarch of her household. </p>

        <h3>DELHI</h3>
        <p>Women are still often treated as second class citizens in India, and sometimes denied basic rights such as independence, education, and safety. Yet as I traveled, I observed women working along side men, from factory to field. I saw this woman gathering crops from the fields dressed in an ethereal white sari, a sight that conveyed both strength and delicacy. </p>

        <p>Kitchens are the domain of women, and I chanced upon this woman working in a dark, hot kitchen making bread. She shyly looked at me from behind her red veil. </p>

        <p>I passed by this older woman sitting on her balcony and observing the streets below. I liked her watchful expression, almost as if she were standing sentry by her door.</p>
