    <h2> Unlike in the United States, many facets of Indian life&mdash;such as work, play, bathing, and prayer&mdash;take place on the street and other public venues. Men are particularly visible in public life, and simply walking around afforded me a small glimpse into their lives.</h2>

        <h3>VARANASI</h3>
        <p>Siddharth is a yogi who runs an ashram in Varanasi, a holy city in the state of Uttar Pradesh through which the Ganges River runs. While yoga is popular in the west for its physical benefits, in India yoga is a physical and spiritual practice with ancient roots. In this portrait, Siddharth is the embodiment of both the physical and spiritual sides of yoga.</p>

        <h3>VARANASI</h3>
        <p>Saddhu are religious ascentics in Hinduism and Jainism who renounce the wordly life. Dressed in saffron robes, they could be seen collecting alms and begging all along the Ganges. Many Indians consider them as holy rather than as homeless beggars. </p>

        <h3>VARANASI</h3>
        <p>Animal life abounds in the city streets of Varanasi. Goats, cows, and many stray dogs roam the streets, often disrupting traffic. Most locals ignore these animals, but I captured this man smiling at the sight of two street dogs playing. </p>

        <h3>JAIPUR</h3>
        <p>The city of Jaipur is the largest in the state of Rajasthan and also its capital. It is well known for its handicrafts, including its block printed textiles. On a visit to a blockprinting workshop, I saw how these textiles were made: craftsmen would repeatedly ink and pound a pattern block with their hands down the length of a piece of fabric about 20 feet long, as seen in this portrait. </p>

    <figcaption>
        <h3>JODHPUR</h3>
        <p>Unlike in the States where work is often tucked away behind the scenes in factories, stores, and offices, much manual labor in India takes place on the streets, including barber services, tailoring, and cooking. This man was stirring a steaming cauldron of milk for use in sweets and paneer (Indian cheese). </p>
