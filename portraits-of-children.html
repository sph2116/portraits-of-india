    <h2>There's a charming unguardedness and curiosity to children. As I traveled, adults were more wary of being photographed but children would often ask for their picture to be taken, laughing when they saw their image on the LCD screen on the back of my camera. </h2>

        <p>"Hi! My name is Dev." I was taking a picture whilst sightseeing in Jodhpur when this schoolboy jumped in front of my camera and asked for a photo. I was struck by his outgoingness and curiosity.</p>

        <h3>OSIYAN</h3>
        <p>This shy little boy snuck a peek at me from behind his father's leg. The whole village of Osiyan had gathered around me and my travel companions when we arrived. Many residents of the small rural village, especially the young children, had never seen foreign travellers before. But they were curious and welcoming, inviting us to their homes and handing us baby goats to hold. </p>

        <h3>JODPHUR</h3>
        <p>The city of Jodhpur is famous for its brilliant blue architecture, which surround its magnificent Mehrangarh Fort. It is purported that the blue walls help keep the blazing heat and ferocious mosquitos at bay. I was photographing the city below from a hill when I saw this girl looking at me from her window. </p>

        <p>I photographed this boy and his brothers playing with a toy tricycle on the street in Jodhpur. When I asked for a picture, the boy looked directly into the camera with a bold directiness.</p>
